It was for nearly 40 years I was introduced to computers. The company I was hired by, bought its first mainframe. 
It was an IBM which was nearly as big as the room where is was installed. Along with that computer, IBM delivered a huge amount of books with in. 
It was allowed by the company to learn to make yourself confident with the system. For me the system felt logical and in no time I was confident with it. 
Soon I concluded that computers would be the tool of tomorrow. That’s how I started with my first personal computer. 
After following a course in machine learning for the 65xx processor, my first software program was published in a computer magazine. 
So computers and programming always kept my interest. In my work I’ve had a lot of advantage in the knowledge I built. Writing this book has two reasons. 
First of all it’s a present for the youngest member of our family. He cleared his VWO exam (which is a pre academic scholar). 
And after the summer vacation he start with his academic education program. Years ago I told him about my published software. 
He was so curious about it that I promised him to write a book that encourage people to free up there mind and write a program. 
The time is now to publish this book an I truly hope that with the information in this book, you’ll start with programming yourself. 
Step by step I’ll guide you to the program Dorethy. Dorethy is a fictive person with a fictive camping site. 
Dorethy needs a payment system for her camping shop and she made it herself. Enjoy!
